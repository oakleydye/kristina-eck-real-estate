## For Buyers: Winning in Spring Competition

Spring brings more homes but also more buyers. Here's how to compete:

### Get Pre-Approved (Not Just Pre-Qualified)

**Pre-Approval Shows:**
- You're a serious buyer
- You can close quickly
- You're financially qualified
- Sellers should take your offer seriously

**Documents Needed:**

**Timeline Expectations:**
- Good homes: offers within 3-5 days

### Making Competitive Offers

In hot spring markets, your offer must stand out:

#### Offer Price

**Strategy Options:**

**Clean Offer at List Price:**

- Shows you're serious
- Respects seller's pricing

**Escalation Clause:**

#### Terms That Matter

**Attractive to Sellers:**

**Flexible Closing:**

- Competitive: 3-5%
- Aggressive: 5-10%

**Cover Appraisal Gap:**
- "Will cover up to $X if appraises low"
- Common in hot markets
- Removes seller risk

#### Personal Touch

**Write a Letter:**
- Who you are
- Why you love the home
- Your story
- Keep it brief (1 page)
- Include family photo

**Timing:**
- Submit with offer
- Don't be generic
