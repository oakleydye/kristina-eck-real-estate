November in Cache Valley has arrived bringing crisp mornings, golden leaves, and that awkward “do I need a jacket or not?” kind of weather. It’s also full of reasons to celebrate our amazing community! If you’re looking for fun things to do around Cache Valley this month, we’ve rounded up local events, homeowner tips, dining favorites, and (of course) a quick real estate market update.  

## Cache Valley Real Estate Update. 

Even as the weather cools, the Logan area market is still heating up. Buyers are eager to get settled before the holidays, and sellers can take advantage of fewer competing listings. Whether you’re wondering what your home might sell for or browsing homes in Logan, North Logan, Smithfield, or Hyrum, we’ve got your neighborhood covered. Cache County’s housing market held steady this September, with a median sales price of $506,028 and an average of $476,034, showing a modest year-over-year rise. The county saw 156 new listings and 120 closed sales, with homes averaging 77 days on market. Inventory inched up to 5.0 months, giving buyers a little more to choose from, while the average price per square foot came in at $207. Sellers are still landing an average of 96.3% of their list price, but our clients average 99.08% which is roughly $13,000 more in their pockets (and who couldn’t use that around the holidays?).  

## November Homeowner Tips  

Stay ahead of winter with these practical tips—because frostbite and frozen garage doors are nobody’s friend: Service Your Garage Door Before Winter: Cold temperatures can be brutal on garage door springs and openers. Give those moving parts a little love with some lubrication and check the door balance. Think of it as a spa day for your garage way cheaper than calling a repairman in a blizzard. Protect Outdoor Furniture and Decks: Clean, cover, or store your patio furniture, grills, and cushions before the snow makes its grand entrance. Slap on a deck sealant now, and you’ll thank yourself when your deck isn’t hosting a mini iceberg come February. Inspect Attic Insulation and Ventilation: Proper insulation keeps your home warm and your energy bills less horrifying. Make sure your attic isn’t trying to give your heat the cold shoulder, and prevent ice dams from forming on your roof because nobody likes a frozen waterfall indoors.
