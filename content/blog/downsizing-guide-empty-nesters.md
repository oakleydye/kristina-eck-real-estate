## Decluttering Strategies

### The Systematic Approach

**By Room Method:**

Start with easiest rooms, build momentum:

1. **Guest rooms** (least emotional)
2. **Formal spaces** (rarely used)
3. **Kitchen** (duplicate items)
4. **Bathrooms** (expired products)
5. **Master bedroom** (personal but necessary)
6. **Garage/basement** (most challenging)
7. **Attic** (memorabilia - save for last)

**By Category Method (Marie Kondo Style):**

1. **Clothes** first
2. **Books**
3. **Papers**
4. **Miscellaneous**
5. **Sentimental** last

### The Four-Box Method

Label boxes for each room:

1. **Keep** - Essential and fits new home
2. **Sell** - Valuable items to liquidate
3. **Donate** - Good condition, not valuable
4. **Trash** - Broken, expired, unusable

### Decision-Making Framework

**For Each Item Ask:**

1. Have I used this in the past year?
2. Will it fit in my new space?
3. Is it worth moving/storing?
4. Does it bring joy or serve a purpose?
5. Can I replace it easily if needed?

**If "No" to Most:** Let it go

### Handling Sentimental Items

**Strategies:**

**Take Photos:**
- Photograph items before donating
- Create digital memory book
- Easier to store than physical items

**Keep Selectively:**
- One representative item from collection
- Best photo from stack
- Favorite dish from set
- Most meaningful memento

**Pass to Family:**
- Offer to kids/grandkids
- Share stories with items
- Don't force - offer only
- Their choice to decline

**Digitize:**
- Scan old photos
- Record videos of you telling stories
- Digital scrapbooks
- Cloud storage for access anywhere

### What to Do With Everything

**Valuable Items:**
- Estate sale company (they handle everything)
- Consignment shops (furniture, antiques)
- Online marketplace (Facebook, Craigslist)
- Auction house (truly valuable pieces)
- Antique dealers (vintage items)

**Donation Options:**
- Goodwill/Salvation Army (general items)
- Habitat for Humanity (building materials, furniture)
- Women's/homeless shelters (household goods)
- Libraries (books)
- Schools (art supplies, furniture)
- Churches/synagogues (various needs)

**Specialty Items:**
- Medical equipment → hospitals, nursing homes
- Business attire → dress for success programs
- Craft supplies → schools, community centers
- Tools → men's shelters, trade schools
- Musical instruments → schools, music programs
