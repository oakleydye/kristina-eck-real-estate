It’s officially pumpkin spice season in Cache Valley! The leaves are crunching, the nights are chilly, and everywhere you look, pumpkins are multiplying faster than candy corn in a trick-or-treat bucket. October is one of the best months here, not just for the fall colors, but for the community traditions (and food!) that make this valley feel like home.

So grab your sweaters, keep the hot cocoa (or coffee) handy, and let’s dive into what’s happening this month.

## Cache County Market Update – August 2025

Here’s how the market stacked up:
- Homes Sold: 114
- New Listings: 165
- Average Days on Market: 77
- Average Sale Price: $480,139

**The scoop:** More homes hitting the market means more options for buyers. Homes are taking a little longer to sell (around two and a half months), so sellers, sharpen that pricing pencil. With the average price holding steady near $480K, Cache Valley continues to be a sweet spot in Utah’s housing scene.

## October Homeowner Tips  

October isn’t just for costumes and candy, it’s the perfect time to get your home cozy and ready for winter. A few tips to keep things running smoothly:

- Test smoke & carbon monoxide detectors. With more candles, heaters, and ovens running, safety first!
- Reverse ceiling fans. Push warm air down to save on heating costs.
- Check your fireplace or stock firewood. Cozy nights by the fire are worth it just make sure it’s clean and safe.
- Light up the porch. Keep trick-or-treaters safe and add a warm, welcoming glow. 

## Local Eats Spotlight
**Jack's Wood-Fired Oven - Logan**

If October had a flavor, it might just be one of Jack’s wood-fired pizzas. With that smoky crust, seasonal toppings, and cozy atmosphere, it’s the perfect spot to warm up after a chilly fall event. Pro tip: grab a pizza to-go and enjoy it at home with a blanket and a movie.
