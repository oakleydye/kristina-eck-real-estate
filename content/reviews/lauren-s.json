    "review": "Working with Kristina was an absolute pleasure! This was our fifth time going through the home-buying process, and it was by far the best experience we’ve had. Kristina’s attention to detail, dedication, and professionalism were unmatched. She was with us every step of the way, from the signing of the purchase and sales agreement to closing day, ensuring that everything went smoothly. Unlike some realtors who tend to disappear during the process, Kristina was always available, responsive, and truly cared about making the experience as stress-free as possible. She also did a fantastic job helping us with negotiations, ensuring we got the best deal. We couldn’t be happier with our new home, and we highly recommend Kristina to anyone looking for a realtor who goes above and beyond!",
