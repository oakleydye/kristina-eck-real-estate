    "review": "Kristina has been an absolute lifesaver for my wife and me as first-time home buyers navigating a challenging market. Her guidance and support made the entire process not just manageable, but enjoyable. Kristina took the time to educate us thoroughly, ensuring we understood each step and felt confident in our decisions.\n\nHer negotiation skills are remarkable. She went to bat for us with the sellers and secured terms that exceeded our hopes. What really set Kristina apart was her extensive network of professionals—inspectors, lenders—she connected us with, all of whom were equally reliable and committed to helping us.\n\nKristina's dedication to her clients is unmatched. She genuinely cares about finding the right home for each person she works with. We cannot recommend Kristina highly enough. Thank you, Kristina, for making our dream of owning a home a reality!"
