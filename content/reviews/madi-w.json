    "review": "I’ve had the privilege of working closely with Kristina for a few years and I can say without hesitation that she is one of the most genuine, honest, and caring people I know. She’s spunky, smart, giving, and always speaks the truth, even when it’s not the easy thing to do. Those who truly know her, know exactly who she is: a straight shooter with a big heart and unwavering principles. I’m proud to work with her and even prouder to call her a friend."
